#Given: Three positive integers k, m, and n, representing a population containing k+m+n organisms:
# k individuals are homozygous dominant for a factor, m are heterozygous, and n are homozygous recessive.
#Return: The probability that two randomly selected mating organisms will produce an individual possessing a
# dominant allele (and thus displaying the dominant phenotype). Assume that any two organisms can mate.
